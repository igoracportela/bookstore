## About the BookStore

I passed my life working on private projects, since 2011. So, I decided to create this API to serve one or more frontend project

## Tasks

- Add n different books.
- List all books.
- Get a specific book.
- Edit a specific book.
- Delete n copies of a specific book.

### Details:
#### Inventory’s structure.
- Book’s title.
- Book’s stock (number of book copies in inventory of this specific book).
- Book titles are unique:
  - If n books have the same title, you must consider them as the same book.
  - If n books have different titles, you must consider them as different books.
-  n > 0.
- Book’s stock can’t be negative.
- There are no more restrictions.
